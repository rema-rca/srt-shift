# srt-shift

Simple project created so I can shift movie subtitle timing. 

Built with JDK 8.

First parameter to execution is full .srt file path(name included) and second parameter is time shift in milliseconds ,prepended with '-' if you want to shift subtitles back in time (e.g. -2000 will shift subtitles two seconds earlier)
